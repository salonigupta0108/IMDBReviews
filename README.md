# IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis Project

This project is a comparative study of different algorithms to implement Sentiment Analysis. The data for analysis is the 'IMDB Reviews Dataset' which has been taken from Kaggle. The dataset has 50,000 reviews of movies of different genres provided by users. It has 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.
I have used 5 different algorithms for Sentiment Analysis. 4 of them are based on training and testing while the fifth one uses a built-in 'vader-lexicon' library in python. 
The first step for Sentiment Analysis is to preprocess the data.
